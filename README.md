# TaskTracker
TaskTracker is a lightweight tool for Windows 10 and 11 that adds task status options to the right-click context menu of folders.<br>
Easily mark folders as Finished, Hidden, Unfinished, or reset them to the Default icon.<br>
⚠️ Icon changes may not appear immediately due to Windows icon cache. One option is to fully restart Explorer, but that feels aggressive.<br>

# Features
* Add or remove task status options from the right-click menu
* Instantly mark folder icons with one of four states:
	* ✅ Finished
	* 🚫 Hidden
	* ❌ Unfinished
	* 📁 Default
* Simple install/uninstall using a single installer

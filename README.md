# TaskTracker
TaskTracker is a lightweight tool for Windows 10 and 11 that adds task status options to the right-click context menu of folders.
Easily mark folders as Finished, Hidden, Unfinished, or reset them to the Default icon.
⚠️ Icon changes may not appear immediately due to Windows icon cache. One option is to fully restart Explorer, but that feels aggressive. ⚠️

# Features
* Add or remove task status options from the right-click menu
* Instantly mark folder icons with one of four states:
	* Finished
	* Hidden
	* Unfinished
	* Default
* Simple install/uninstall using a single installer
